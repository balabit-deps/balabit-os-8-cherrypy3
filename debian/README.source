upstream
========

It seems that version 8.9.1 is the last upstream that can be packaged
in the current manner. On how to support upstream >= 9, some more
brainstorming needs to be done:

- Since v9, the httpd/wsgiserver part has gone to a separate upstream 'cheroot' [1].
- Later versions also require python packages not in Debian yet [2].
- While 8.9.1 seems to be API-compatible with 3.5 to the best of my knowledge, 9.x
	versions at least lack the wsgiserver part, and needs to be checked for other
	possible API changes (to avoid breaking [3]).

test suite
==========

8.9.1-2: The **testsuite** currently does not work properly. It is
still called (see rules), but the results are currently ignored.

Fwiw, tests succeeded here when called manually like so::

	$ ( cd .pybuild/pythonX.Y_2.7/build; python2.7 -m pytest cherrypy/test cherrypy/wsgiserver -l )
	$ ( cd .pybuild/pythonX.Y_3.6/build; python3.6 -m pytest cherrypy/test cherrypy/wsgiserver -l )

However, on package building (and even more on buildds), things go
awry for some reason.
