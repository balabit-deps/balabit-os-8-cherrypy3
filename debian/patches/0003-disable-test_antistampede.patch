Subject: disable test_antistampede

This test spawns many threads that all make a request to an endpoint in
the web server which does nothing but sleep and return a string. The
idea is that if caching works this is very fast, so the test assertion
is that the test was completed quickly.

If the test fails it could run for quite a while, and there is a known
problem upstream which makes this test unreliable which is why it is
marked as allowed to fail for pytest. To speed things up, we disable it
completely until it works more reliably.
